# lib_ili9488

ILI9488 graphics driver for STM32 based on ST's BSP drivers and RobertoBenjami's IO drivers.

This library is based on the [RobertoBenjami/stm32_graphics_display_drivers](https://github.com/RobertoBenjami/stm32_graphics_display_drivers) library. It restructures the files to support simple integration as a library dependency in the PlatformIO IDE without needing to copy files into the project source tree.


# Credits and licensing

All the credits for this code go to RobertoBenjami and STMicroelectronics.

This library doesn't use a license, same as RobertoBenjami's, since certain files are parts of the STMicroelectronics BSP which forbids distributing under open source licenses.
